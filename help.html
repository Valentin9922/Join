            Welcome to the help page for <span class="col-light-blue">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban
            project management tool.
            Here, we'll
            provide
            an overview of what <span class="col-light-blue">Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
        </p>

        <span class="fs-27px fw-700">What is Join?</span>
        <p>
            <span class="col-light-blue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
            group of dedicated students as part
            of
            their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. <br><br>

            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="col-light-blue">Join</span> leverages the
            principles of kanban to help users
            manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface. <br><br>

            It is important to note that <span class="col-light-blue">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise
            and is not intended for extensive
            business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
            availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <span
                class="col-light-blue">Join</span>. <br><br>
        </p>

        <span class="fs-27px fw-700">How to use it</span>
        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="col-light-blue">Join</span>:</p>

        <ol class="mb-32px">
            <li>
                <p>
                    <span class="fs-20px fw-700">Exploring the Board</span><br>
                    When you log in to <span class="col-light-blue">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board
                    represents your project and
                    contains
                    four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <span class="fs-20px fw-700">Creating Contacts</span><br>
                    In <span class="col-light-blue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects.
                    Go to the "Contacts" section, click
                    on
                    "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
                    tasks
                    and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <span class="fs-20px fw-700">Adding Cards</span><br>
                    Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks.
                    Click
                    the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the
                    card,
                    like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <span class="fs-20px fw-700">Moving Cards</span><br>
                    As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                    dropping
                    the card from one list to another.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <span class="fs-20px fw-700">Deleting Cards</span><br>
                    Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card
                    will
                    permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
                    irreversible. <br><br>

                    Remember that using <span class="col-light-blue">Join</span> effectively requires
                    consistent updates from you and your
                    team to
                    ensure the board reflects the current state of your project. <br><br>
